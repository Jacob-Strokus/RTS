# Design Pillars

1. Clarity at Scale
   - Readable silhouettes & color-coded factions; minimal visual noise.
   - Information layering: essential (HP bars, selection rings) always crisp; advanced details on demand.
2. Strategic Depth with Low APM Burden
   - Smart default behaviors (auto-gather, auto-scout later) reduce micromanagement tax.
   - Formations & logistics encourage planning, not click-spam.
3. Living Battlefield
   - Seasons & weather shift tactical considerations (vision, movement, economy modifiers) without becoming RNG chaos.
4. Territory & Supply Matter
   - Expansion decisions shape economy efficiency & army sustain; frontlines emerge naturally.
5. Moddable Foundation
   - Data-driven units/buildings/tech; scripting hook design for future UGC.
6. Determinism-Ready
   - Early simulation isolation avoids major rewrite for future multiplayer.

## Anti-Pillars (What We Avoid)
- Excess hero-centric RPG layers (keep focus on armies & economy first).
- Overwhelming micro bonuses that force high APM to stay competitive.
- Visual clutter that obscures unit silhouettes in large engagements.

## Player Experience Goals
- Early Game: Exploration & deliberate expansion tension.
- Mid Game: Territorial contests, strategic tech branching.
- Late Game: Large multi-front maneuvers leveraging supply lines & weather windows.

## Differentiators vs Classic RTS
- Integrated logistics efficiency (soft, not punitive starvation mechanic).
- Seasonal cadence providing predictable planning windows.
- Territory-based economic multipliers rewarding map control patterns.
